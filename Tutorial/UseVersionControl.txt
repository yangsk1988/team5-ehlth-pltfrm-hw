
1.some files are not necessary to put in version control.
e.g. the whole "Java" folder.
Once you have java runtime environment installed, and set the right environment parameter. The Arduino IDE will launch Java in your system instead.


2. Don't try to put Eclipse Workspace folder into dropbox. 
Eclipse sometime get crazy, it first move project folder out of the folder "Dropbox\MyWorkspace\" and copy to "C:\Workspace"(may be this is the default directory!). Then after you close eclipse, files in "Dropbox\MyWorkspace\" come back. So I suggest not doing that to prevent any problem.
